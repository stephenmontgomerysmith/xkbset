xkbset is a program rather like xset in that it allows you to set
various features of the X window interface.  It allows one to configure
most of the options connected with the XKB extensions.  They are described
in Section 10 of XKBlib.ps.

This includes customizing the following:
  MouseKeys:  using the numeric pad keys to move the mouse;
  StickyKeys: where modifiers like control and shift will lock until the
              next key press (good for one finger typing);
  SlowKeys:   The keys will not work unless they are pressed for a certain
              amount of time;
  BounceKeys: If a key is pressed more than once rapidly, only one key
              press will be registered.

I also include a gui program xkbset-gui which is a GUI program to play
with the mousekeys acceleration parameters.  It is written in Perl/Tk,
so Perl/Tk will need to be installed on your machine.

If you have any improvents or ideas, please send them to me.

Also, if you use this program and like it, please tell me so.  If I
don't get much feedback, I will assume no one is interested, and
I won't develop it further (in particular I won't finish the man page).
